# Guessing Game One   
# Exercise 9 
# Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). 
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 
# (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

# Extras:

# Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
# Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


import random
a = random.randint(1, 9)
guess = int(input('Guess the number that I\'m thinking of. '))

while a != guess:
    print('Wrong, guess again!')
    guess = int(input('Guess the number that I\'m thinking of. '))
else: 
    print('You got it! The number is ', a)
