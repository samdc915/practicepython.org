# Exercise 3
# Take a list, say for example this one:

#  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# Extras:

# Instead of printing the elements one by one, 
# make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the 
# original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

a = []

num = int(input('Add a number to the list. Enter 0 to close the list: '))

while num != 0:
    a.append(num)
    num = int(input('Add a number to the list. Enter 0 to close the list: '))
else:
    print('Great, this is your list:', a)
    print('The numbers less than 5 are: ')

for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        print(i)
        
print('Now let\'s create a new list of all these numbers in ascending order.')

new_list = []

for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        new_list.append(i)
        

print(sorted(new_list))
