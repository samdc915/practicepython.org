# String Lists
# Exercise 6 (and Solution)
# Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
# (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

word = input('Enter a word: ')
palindrome_check = word[::-1]

if word == palindrome_check:
    print('That\'s a palindrome.')
else:
    print('That word is not a palindrome.')
