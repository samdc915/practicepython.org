## Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
## Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

## Extras:

## Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number 
## and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
## Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
## Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button

name = input('What is your name? ')
age = int(input('How old are you, ' + name + '? '))
age_100 = str(100 - age)

print(name + ', You will turn 100 in ' + age_100 + ' years.')



name = input('What is your name? ')
age = int(input('How old are you, ' + name + '? '))
number_times = int(input('Enter a random number: '))

age_100 = str(100 - age)

while number_times > 0:
    print(name + ', You will turn 100 in ' + age_100 + ' years. ') 
    number_times -= 1
