# Rock Paper Scissors   
# Exercise 8 (and Solution)
# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
# (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, 
# print out a message of congratulations to the winner, 
# and ask if the players want to start a new game)

# Remember the rules:

# Rock beats scissors
# Scissors beats paper
# Paper beats rock

play_1 = input('Player 1, enter your play: ')
play_2 = input('Player 2, enter your play: ')

play_1 = play_1.upper()
play_2 = play_2.upper()

if play_1 == play_2:
    print('You tied!')
elif play_1 == 'ROCK' and play_2 == 'SCISSORS':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
elif play_1 == 'SCISSORS' and play_2 == 'PAPER':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
elif play_1 == 'PAPER' and play_2 == 'ROCK':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
else:
    print('Player 2 wins!')
    
Output:

Player 1, enter your play: rock
Player 2, enter your play: paper
Player 2 wins!

I wrote this much more complicated code on 5/10/2017

def play_game():
    print('This game is rock, paper, scissors. This is a two-player game.')
    print('To play, the game will ask for the player\'s names.')
    print('Then, the player will either enter R for rock, P for paper, S for scissors.')
    print('If you have the same hand, then you must play over.')
    print('Rock smashes scissors. Paper wraps around a rock. Scissors cut paper.')
    print('Enjoy!')
    user_1 = input('what is your name, player 1?: ')
    user_2 = input('what is your name, player 2?: ')
    Hand_1 = input(user_1 + ", enter your play (R, P, or S): ")
    Hand_2 = input(user_2 + ', enter your play (R, P, or S): ')
    hand_1 = Hand_1.lower()
    hand_2 = Hand_2.lower()
    while hand_1 == hand_2:
        print('Tie. Play again.')
        Hand_1 = input(user_1 + ", enter your play (R, P, or S): ")
        Hand_2 = input(user_2 + ', enter your play (R, P, or S): ')
        hand_1 = Hand_1.lower()
        hand_2 = Hand_2.lower()
    else:
        if ((hand_1 == 'r') and (hand_2 == 's')) or ((hand_1 == 'p') and (hand_2 == 'r')) or ((hand_1 == 's')and (hand_2 == 'p')):
            print(user_1 + ', you win!')
        else:
            print(user_2 + ', you win!')
play_game()

Output:

This game is rock, paper, scissors. This is a two-player game.
To play, the game will ask for the player's names.
Then, the player will either enter R for rock, P for paper, S for scissors.
If you have the same hand, then you must play over.
Rock smashes scissors. Paper wraps around a rock. Scissors cut paper.
Enjoy!
what is your name, player 1?: Sam
what is your name, player 2?: John
Sam, enter your play (R, P, or S): R
John, enter your play (R, P, or S): R
Tie. Play again.
Sam, enter your play (R, P, or S): S
John, enter your play (R, P, or S): S
Tie. Play again.
Sam, enter your play (R, P, or S): P
John, enter your play (R, P, or S): R
Sam, you win!
