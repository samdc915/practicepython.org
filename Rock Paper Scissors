# Rock Paper Scissors   
# Exercise 8 (and Solution)
# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
# (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, 
# print out a message of congratulations to the winner, 
# and ask if the players want to start a new game)

# Remember the rules:

# Rock beats scissors
# Scissors beats paper
# Paper beats rock

play_1 = input('Player 1, enter your play: ')
play_2 = input('Player 2, enter your play: ')

play_1 = play_1.upper()
play_2 = play_2.upper()

if play_1 == play_2:
    print('You tied!')
elif play_1 == 'ROCK' and play_2 == 'SCISSORS':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
elif play_1 == 'SCISSORS' and play_2 == 'PAPER':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
elif play_1 == 'PAPER' and play_2 == 'ROCK':
    print('Player 1 wins!')
else:
    print('Player 2 wins!')
    
Output:

Player 1, enter your play: rock
Player 2, enter your play: paper
Player 2 wins!
