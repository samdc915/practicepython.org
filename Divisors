# Divisors  
# Exercise 4 (and Solution)
# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

divisor_list = []

num = int(input('Please, enter a number: '))

for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if num % i == 0:
        divisor_list.append(i)

print(divisor_list)

Output:

Please, enter a number: 12345
[1, 3, 5, 15, 823, 2469, 4115, 12345]
